# Heart Diseases Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains code and notebooks for building machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease from patient clinical data. The goal is to provide a clear, reproducible pipeline for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

(If your repository uses different file names or structure, update the list above accordingly.)

## Dataset
This project uses the Heart Disease dataset (commonly the UCI Cleveland dataset). The data contains patient attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope of ST, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thalassemia, and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

Dataset source (example):
- UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

If the dataset file is not included in this repository, add a data downloading script or instructions to obtain the data and place it in the data/ directory.

## Features (typical)
- age
- sex
- cp (chest pain type)
- trestbps (resting blood pressure)
- chol (serum cholesterol)
- fbs (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
- restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
- thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
- exang (exercise induced angina)
- oldpeak (ST depression)
- slope (slope of the peak exercise ST segment)
- ca (number of major vessels colored)
- thal (thalassemia)

## Models
This repository demonstrates training and evaluating several classical classification models such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Gradient Boosting (optional: XGBoost / LightGBM)

Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation are performed in the notebooks.

## Results
Include a short summary of results such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for the best model. Example:
- Best model: Random Forest
- Accuracy: 0.87
- Precision: 0.86
- Recall: 0.88
- F1-score: 0.87
- AUC: 0.92

(Replace the above numbers with your actual results from training.)

## Requirements
Create a requirements.txt with pinned versions. Example packages to include:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter
- joblib
- xgboost (if used)

Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/RohitKumarJain16/Heart-Diseases-Prediction-using-ML.git
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # on Unix or macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the notebooks folder and run the notebooks in order with Jupyter or use the provided scripts.

## Usage
- To preprocess data: run the data preprocessing notebook or script in notebooks/ or src/.
- To train models: open 02_model_training.ipynb and run the cells or run the training script if available.
- To make predictions: use src/predict.py or a Jupyter notebook cell that loads a saved model from models/ and runs model.predict on new samples.

Example prediction snippet:

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

model = joblib.load('models/best_model.pkl')

sample = pd.DataFrame([{
    'age': 60,
    'sex': 1,
    'cp': 2,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 0,
    'restecg': 1,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 0,
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}])

pred = model.predict(sample)
print('Prediction (0=no disease, 1=disease):', pred)
```

## Reproducibility
- Set a random seed in notebooks and scripts to ensure reproducible results.
- Log model parameters and results. Consider using MLflow or a simple CSV/log file to record experiments.
